**Objective**
The objective in an optimization problem is the goal that you want to achieve, typically represented as an equation that you want to maximize or minimize.<br>
In the case of the simple example I provided, the objective is to maximize profit. The company makes two types of products, A and B, and the goal is to maximize the total profit from selling these products while respecting resource constraints.<br>
**Objective Function Explanation:**<br>
The objective function in this problem is:<br>
Maximize Profit= 3.xA+ 4.xB<br>
Where:<br>
xAis the number of units of Product A produced. <br>
xBis the number of units of Product B produced.<br>
The coefficients 3 and 4 represent the profit per unit of Product A and Product B, respectively.
The goal is to maximize this objective function subject to the resource constraints (availability of resources 1 and 2).
<br>
Let's go with a simpler example for an optimization problem using linear programming.
**Problem Example:**
A company makes two types of products, A and B. The company has limited resources, and the goal is to maximize its profit.<br>
Profit per unit:
Product A: $3<br>
Product B: $4<br>
Resource Constraints:<br>
Each unit of Product A requires 2 units of resource 1 and 1 unit of resource 2.<br>
Each unit of Product B requires 1 unit of resource 1 and 2 units of resource 2.<br>
Resource availability:<br>
Resource 1: 6 units<br>
Resource 2: 6 units<br>
The company wants to maximize its profit while respecting the resource constraints.<br>

**Mathematical Formulation**<br>
**Decision Variables:** <br>
Let 𝑥.𝐴 be the number of units of Product A produced.<br>
Let 𝑥.𝐵 be the number of units of Product B produced.<br>
**Objective Function:** Maximize profit:<br>
Maximize Z=3x.A+4x.B<br>
**Constraints:** <br>
Resource 1: 2𝑥.𝐴+𝑥.𝐵 ≤6 <br>
Resource 2 :x.A+2x.B ≤6<br>
Non-negativity: x.A≥0,x.B≥0 <br>

 **Explanation**
<br> **Decision Variables:** <br>
We define 𝑥.𝐴 and x.B as continuous variables representing the number of units of Product A and B to produce, respectively. <br>
**Obective Function:** <br>
The profit from producing products A and B is represented by 3𝑥.𝐴+4𝑥.𝐵, which we want to maximize. <br>
**Constraints:** <br>
The first constraint represents the usage of resource 1, and the second one represents the usage of resource 2. Both must be less than or equal to the available resources (6 units each).<br>
**Solve:** <br>
The optimization problem is solved, and the values of x.A and x.B will tell us how many units of Product A and Product B to produce for the maximum profit.
